# My Python GitHub Repository

## Introduction

As a beginner in Python programming, I have found that the best way to learn is through practical projects. I have created a GitHub repository that holds some of my Python projects on topics like control flow and variables. In this blog post, I will introduce some of the projects in my repository.

## Variables

Variables are used to store values in Python. Some of the projects in my repository that cover variables include:
Currency converter app, Growth/decay app, Slope app, and Quadratic formula app.
## Control Flow

Control flow statements are used to control the execution of code based on certain conditions. One of the projects in my repository that cover control flow include:

Temperature Converter a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use variables to store the temperature value and whether it is in Celsius or Fahrenheit, and use if/else statements to handle the conversion.
